LOOT API Python Module
=======================

A Python module that wraps the LOOT API, generated by [pybind11](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11).

## Build Instructions

The module's build system uses [CMake](https://cmake.org/), so make sure it's installed, then run it, and build the generated solution file.

Only Windows support has been tested, though Linux builds should also be possible.

## Usage

Copy the `loot_api.pyd` file that is built and the `loot_api.dll` file in the same directory to wherever you wish to import the module from, then:

```
>>> import loot_api
>>> loot_api.loot_is_compatible(0,9,0)
True
```

**Note:** The module is currently built against revision [22d0577](https://github.com/loot/loot/tree/22d0577415ef3e8598d5e145209b14e03c4e144e) of the API, which is post-0.9.2 and pre-0.10.0, but uses the v0.10 metadata syntax (as specified at that revision, in case there are further changes before the v0.10 release).
