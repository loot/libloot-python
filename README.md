=======================

[![AppVeyor Build Status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/k2ugge3po7254o1o/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/LOOT/loot-api-python/branch/master)
[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/loot-api-python/badge/)](http://loot-api-python.readthedocs.io/)

A Python module that wraps the LOOT API, generated by [pybind11](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11). Not everything in the API is exposed: coverage can be extended on request (or by pull request).

## Downloads

Snapshot builds are available on [Bintray](https://bintray.com/loot/snapshots/loot-api-python). The snapshot build archives are named like so:

```
loot_api_python-<short revision ID>-win32.7z
```

For example `loot_api_python-94de368-win32.7z` was built using the revision with shortened commit ID `94de368`.

## Documentation

The documentation can be found online at [Read The Docs](http://loot-api-python.readthedocs.org/).

## Build Instructions

The module's build system uses [CMake](https://cmake.org/) and requires [Python](https://www.python.org) (tested with 2.7). Make sure they're installed, then run CMake, and build the generated solution file.

Only Windows support has been tested, though Linux builds should also be possible.
